# learn-php
Hello there, this is a temporary repo to learn php myself.

If you want to run php server locally, i suggest to install it with the following command:
```sh
brew install php
```

Then, there is a script which runs automatically every time you open this folder with Vscode.
If you don't have Vscode, make sure to install it.
